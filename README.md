ðŸš€ Project Completed: Spam Email Detection ðŸš€

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my latest project on spam email detection! ðŸŽ‰ This project involved:

Leveraging advanced Random Forest techniques to build a robust classification model
Utilizing Grid Search and Random Search for hyperparameter optimization
Achieving high accuracy in classifying spam vs. non-spam emails
A huge thank you to Code Cue  for providing the invaluable Machine Learning internship opportunity that made this project possible. Your support has been instrumental in my growth and success. ðŸ™Œ

Looking forward to more learning and exciting challenges ahead!
